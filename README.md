# PF2 graphql project

The goal was to learn graphql and also provide an API that others can use to drive their webapps
It is hosted on firebase here [API link, will show graphiql](https://us-central1-pf2-graphql.cloudfunctions.net/api/graphql)

This is built off the data that is generated from my other project [PF2 data scrapper](https://github.com/jimbarnesrtp/pf2)
