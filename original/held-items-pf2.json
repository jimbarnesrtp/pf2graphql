The phylactery then rebuilds the lich\u2019s undead body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich\u2019s phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.",

This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator."

            "Effect": " You place the door knocker against a wall, floor, or ceiling. The door knocker fuses in place and creates a usable door within the surface. Any creature can move through the door normally, as if the door had always been there. The door can penetrate up to 1 foot of material, so thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. A thin layer of metal in a wall, floor, or ceiling also causes the effect to fail. You can use an Interact action to release the door knocker from the surface and return the surface to its previous shape.",

            "Effect": " As you flip through the book, you think about a broad topic you want to know more about. Choose one skill: Arcana, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Occultism, Religion, Society, or a single subcategory of Lore. The book\u2019s pages fill with information about that skill, though only you can see the information. While the pages are full, you can spend an Interact action perusing the book just before attempting a check to Recall Knowledge with the chosen skill. This grants you a +3 item bonus to the check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. The information within the book disappears after 24 hours or when the tome is activated again."
