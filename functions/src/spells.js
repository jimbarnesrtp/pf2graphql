You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your other traits while in this form, as well as any trait related to the creature\u2019s kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (as the shrink spell). This transformation doesn\u2019t change your statistics in any way, and you don\u2019t gain any special abilities of the humanoid form you assume. You can still wear and use your gear, which changes size (if necessary) to match your new form. If items leave your person, they return to their usual size. Humanoid form grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and you add your level even if you\u2019re untrained, but you can\u2019t make yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM won\u2019t factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the DC of your Deception check. You can dismiss this spell. Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or Low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability. Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of the enlarge spell."

    "spellText": "You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can\u2019t speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you\u2019re trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC \u2013 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion\u2019s attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion\u2019s Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn\u2019t correspond to the image of the monster\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage\u00e2\u0080\u0094the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn\u2019t take any further damage from it. Heightened (+1) The damage of the image\u2019s Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan)."

Unlike with the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn\u2019t include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it\u2019s hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You\u2019re unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.

Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell\u2019s duration. Performing a hostile action doesn\u2019t end mislead\u2019s invisibility, just like a 4th-level invisibility spell. A creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn\u2019t necessarily know you\u2019re invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn\u2019t necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion. If you cast a spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt a Deception check against observers\u2019 Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate used that action. This doesn\u2019t fool anyone who\u2019s aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn\u2019t have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would automatically fail."

Name war or peace when you cast this spell. If you name\u201dwar,\u201d mentally choose one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target\u2019s turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. If you name\u201dpeace,\u201d mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike). Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target\u2019s turn, but its penalty is separate from yours. When the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn\u2019t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can\u2019t make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon. Heightened (10th) The force damage increases by 1d10."
